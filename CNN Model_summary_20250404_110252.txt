**Project Title:** CIFAR-100 CNN Model

**Objective:**

* Develop a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-100 dataset.

**Dataset Description:**

* Contains 60,000 images with 32x32 pixel resolution and 3 color channels (RGB).
* Divided into training (50,000 images) and testing (10,000 images) subsets.
* Diverse dataset with wide variety of categories, including animals, vehicles, household objects, and plants.

**Data Preprocessing:**

* Normalization to scale pixel values between 0 and 1.
* One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical labels into one-hot vectors.
* Data splitting for training and validation sets.

**Model Architecture:**

* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is implemented.

**Key Points:**

* CIFAR-100 is a challenging classification problem due to its complexity.
* CNN is a popular neural network architecture for image classification.
* Data preprocessing is crucial for model performance.
* Model architecture includes multiple layers of convolutional and pooling operations.

The text describes the architecture and training process of a CNN for image classification. 

**Key points:**

* CNNs are well-suited for image classification due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images.
* The model consists of multiple convolutional and max-pooling layers followed by a fully-connected layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation.
* The model is compiled using Adam optimizer with categorical cross-entropy loss function and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
* The model is trained for 50 epochs with an initial learning rate.
* The model's accuracy on the test dataset is reported as 90%.

Sure, here's a summary of the text you provided:

- An image from the test dataset was selected for prediction.
- The model predicted the class using the max probability method.
- The predicted label was then compared with the actual label.
- The actual label was compared with the predicted label to evaluate the model's performance.
- The CNN model achieved a reasonable level of accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset.
- Improvements can be made to achieve higher accuracy and robustness.
